My name is Cameron Levine, and I’m a video game programmer from Wisconsin. I am currently attending UW-Whitewater for a major in Computer Science, and will be graduating in May of 2022. I’m open for work, and if you’d like to contact me, send me a message on my [email](chaotixlevine@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-levine-930242214).
