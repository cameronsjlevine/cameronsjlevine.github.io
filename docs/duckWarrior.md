Duck Warrior is a 2D platformer where you control a duck with a knife strapped to his chest attempting to get his hat back. Each stage is an arena, where you have to kill waves of enemies before facing off against a boss. It was a fun project with an absurd concept that made my first game in Unity a memorable one.

The starting inspiration for Duck Warrior was the game “Joust”, an Atari game where you joust on an ostrich. From this, we derived two things: ramming into enemies in order to kill them, and birds. Unlike its inspiration, however, Duck Warrior focuses less on 1v1 battles against similar enemies and focuses more on level progression and boss fights.
