My name is Cameron Levine, and this is my video game development portfolio. Here you will find information on some of the projects I have worked on in the past, detailing my experiences in making games. You can also find my [resume](https://cameronsjlevine.github.io/resumeOld/#titleSection) for a more condensed and formal version of my experience, as well as a brief section [about me](https://cameronsjlevine.github.io/aboutOld/#titleSection).
